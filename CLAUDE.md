# xcalibre-server — Claude Context

## Project
Rust rewrite of calibre-web. Self-hosted ebook library manager.
Full architecture: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
Schema: docs/SCHEMA.md
API contract: docs/API.md
Design spec: docs/DESIGN.md
Skills reference: docs/SKILLS.md

## Status
Phase 21 complete (v2.2.0). 44 tables, 28 migrations. Phases 1–21 all shipped.

## Stack
- Backend: Rust, Axum 0.7, sqlx 0.7, SQLite default / MariaDB optional
- Frontend: React + Vite + TanStack Router + shadcn/ui + react-i18next (EN/FR/DE/ES)
- Mobile: Expo (iOS + Android) — complete
- Search: Meilisearch + sqlite-vec embeddings

## Key Paths
- `backend/src/` — Axum app (api/, db/, middleware/)
- `backend/migrations/` — sqlx migrations (sqlite/ and mariadb/)
- `backend/tests/` — integration tests (TDD — tests written before implementation)
- `docker/` — Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Caddyfile
- `evals/fixtures/` — LLM prompt eval fixtures

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
- TDD: tests written first, implementation makes them pass — this applies to both Rust backend tests and React RTL frontend tests
- Frontend: every component introduced in a phase must have a corresponding `.test.tsx` in the same phase. Mock only at the network boundary (MSW). Never mock React hooks or TanStack Query internals.
- Phase file fidelity: any change made during a build (bug fix, API shape adjustment, component refactor, config change) must be reflected back in the corresponding phase file before committing. The phase files are the source of truth for how the system is built — a future clean build from the phase files must arrive at the same working state as the current codebase.
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass at zero warnings
- `cargo audit` must pass at zero vulnerabilities
- All LLM calls: 10s timeout, silent fallback, never surface errors to users
- `ENABLE_LLM_FEATURES = false` by default
- No secrets hardcoded — config.toml + env var overrides only
- Path traversal prevention on all file serving routes
- All 5 security headers on every response

## Skills Workflow (use at every Codex checkpoint)
- After every Codex stage: `/review` (engineering:code-review)
- After Stage 3 auth and Stage 4 books: `/review` + `/simplify` in parallel
- After Stage 6 security: `/review` + `/security-review` in parallel
- After Stage 7 docker: `/engineering:deploy-checklist`
- On failing tests: `/engineering:debug`
- Start of any new session: `/engineering:standup` to reorient on progress

## MCP Tools (xcalibre-server-dev server)
Register once: `claude mcp add xcalibre-server-dev node tools/mcp_server.js`
- `run_tests [filter]` — run cargo tests, optionally filtered
- `cargo_check` — fast compile check
- `cargo_clippy` — lint with -D warnings
- `cargo_audit` — CVE check
- `db_query <sql>` — query dev SQLite DB (SELECT/PRAGMA only)
- `list_tables` — list DB tables with row counts
- `run_migrations` — apply sqlx migrations

## Library MCP Server (for agents)
Build: `cargo build --release -p calibre-mcp`
Register with Claude Code:
`claude mcp add xcalibre-server-library ./target/release/calibre-mcp --env CONFIG_PATH=./config.toml`
Exposes: `search_books`, `get_book_metadata`, `list_chapters`, `get_book_text`, `semantic_search`

## Code Style
- Rust edition 2021
- No unwrap() in production code — use ? and proper error types
- AppError implements IntoResponse — all handlers return Result<T, AppError>
- Tests use TestContext::new().await — never share state between tests
